# SPECTACLE

-------------------
What is SPECTACLE
-------------------

SPECTACLE is a software package that can evaluate the quality of error correction tool outputs. It can handle DNA and RNA sequencing data from any sequencing technology, and differentiate heterozygosity from sequencing errors.

We have also designed input read sets that stress the challenges in error correction such as heterozygosity, coverage variation, and repeats. These reads can be used as standard inputs for the evaluation of error correction tools.

SPECTACLE was developed by the ESCAD group in University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
